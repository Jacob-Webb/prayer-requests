# prayer_requests
As churches grow larger and have a greater presence online, it can be harder to keep up constant communication with the people that they serve. This app is aimed at 
helping to close that gap by allowing members to send prayer requests directly to the church leaders. On the front end the user simply fills out the form. On the back end
prayer requests can be tracked by how long ago it was sent and by what type of prayer was requested. This should give the leadership a snapshot of what issues the 
community is facing at a given time.
